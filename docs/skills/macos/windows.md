# macOS Window Management

Foundations of multi-window macOS apps — picking the right scene type, opening and dismissing windows, default sizing and placement, toolbar styles, MenuBarExtra, and UtilityWindow.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you're:
- Choosing between `WindowGroup`, `Window`, `UtilityWindow`, `MenuBarExtra`, and `Settings`
- Opening or dismissing windows programmatically via `openWindow`/`dismissWindow`
- Setting default window size, position, or resizability
- Building a multi-window macOS app from an iOS-first codebase
- Adding a data-driven detail WindowGroup that should only open programmatically
- Customizing window toolbar style or removing default menu commands
- Adding a menu bar extra (standalone utility or companion to a main app)
- Debugging windows that won't open, open duplicates, or lose state on relaunch

## Example Prompts

Questions you can ask Claude that will draw from this skill:

- "Should I use `WindowGroup` or `Window` for my activity monitor panel?"
- "How do I open a detail window from a context menu without adding a 'New Detail Window' item to the File menu?"
- "Why does my app quit when I close the main window?"
- "My `.defaultSize` is ignored on relaunch — is that a bug?"
- "How do I make a floating Inspector window that stays above the main app?"

## What This Skill Provides

### Scene Type Selection
- Decision tree across `WindowGroup`, `Window`, `UtilityWindow`, `MenuBarExtra`, `Settings`, and `DocumentGroup`
- Platform availability matrix (macOS 11+, 13+, 15+; iPadOS/visionOS where supported)
- Why `Window` as the primary scene causes the app to quit when closed

### Window Lifecycle
- `@Environment(\.openWindow)` and `@Environment(\.dismissWindow)`
- Data-driven WindowGroups with `for:` parameter — `Hashable + Codable` presentation values
- Why you pass IDs, not full model objects, to `openWindow(value:)`
- `@Environment(\.openSettings)` for opening the Settings scene programmatically

### Default Size, Position, and Resizability
- `.defaultSize`, `.defaultPosition`, `.defaultWindowPlacement` (macOS 14+)
- Why `defaultSize` is ignored once the user has resized — and why that's correct
- `.windowResizability(.automatic / .contentSize / .contentMinSize)`

### Toolbar and Window Styles
- `.windowStyle(.automatic / .hiddenTitleBar / .titleBar)`
- `.windowToolbarStyle(.unified / .unifiedCompact / .expanded)` and when each fits
- `.commandsRemoved()` for suppressing the auto-generated "New Window" item

### MenuBarExtra
- Standalone utility apps (`LSUIElement = true` in Info.plist)
- `.menuBarExtraStyle(.menu)` vs `.menuBarExtraStyle(.window)` for richer content

### UtilityWindow (macOS 15+)
- Floating panels that stay above main windows and receive FocusedValues
- Auto-toggle in the View menu, Escape-to-dismiss, hide-when-app-loses-focus

## Key Pattern

Use `Window` for singletons and `WindowGroup` for everything else. For data-driven detail windows that should open only via code, suppress the auto-generated File menu item with `.commandsRemoved()`.

```swift
WindowGroup("Book Details", for: Book.ID.self) { $bookId in
    BookDetail(id: $bookId)
}
.commandsRemoved()  // Only open via openWindow(value:)
```

Pass identifiers, never struct values — value types get copied and edits won't sync.

## Documentation Scope

This page documents the `windows` skill in the `axiom-macos` suite. The skill file contains comprehensive guidance Claude uses when answering your questions about scene types, lifecycle, and window styling.
