# Skill Map

Visual overview of Axiom's two-layer routing architecture. 17 routers organize 154 skills, 35 agents, and 10 commands into discoverable domains.

## How It Works

Axiom uses **progressive disclosure** — you never need to memorize skill names. Ask a question, and the right router activates automatically:

1. **Your question** hits one of 17 domain routers
2. The **router** selects the right specialized skill, agent, or command
3. You get **expert guidance** tailored to your specific issue

## Overview

<SkillMapGrid />

**Discipline** skills teach idiomatic workflows and best practices. **Reference** skills provide complete API guides with code examples. **Diagnostic** skills offer troubleshooting decision trees for specific failure patterns. **Agents** scan your code autonomously and report issues. **Commands** are explicit `/axiom:` invocations for on-demand audits.
