# MapKit Diagnostics

Symptom-based MapKit troubleshooting for annotations, region jumping, clustering, search, and performance issues.

## Symptoms This Diagnoses

Use when you're experiencing:
- Annotations not appearing on the map
- Map region jumping or looping
- Performance issues with many annotations
- Clustering not working
- Overlays not rendering
- Search returning no or wrong results
- User location not showing
- Coordinate system confusion (lat/lng swapped)

## Example Prompts

- "My annotations aren't showing on the map"
- "The map keeps jumping back when I try to scroll"
- "Clustering isn't grouping my annotations"
- "MKLocalSearch returns no results"
- "My map overlay isn't visible"
- "User location dot isn't appearing"

## Diagnostic Workflow

Start with the symptom you're seeing in the quick reference table, then follow the numbered diagnostic steps for that symptom. Each step narrows the cause and provides a specific fix.
